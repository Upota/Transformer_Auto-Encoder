# Transformer_Auto-Encoder
This model heads to denoising auto encoder model with an attention mechanism for time series sequential data.  
The model was implemented based on the Transformer.   
  
When a noisy signal enters the input, the model removes the noise of the signal.  
  
## Achieved
Succeeded in implementing a supervised transformer denoising auto-encoder.  

## Things To Improve
* Looking for ways to develop into an unsupervised learning model.  
* Reasonable performance metrics should be introduced.  
* Need to improving performance.  
  
__Improvements are ongoing.__
